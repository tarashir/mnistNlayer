# mnistNlayer
Running the code:
1) download and unzip the folder
2) run ConvolutionalPreprocessing.py.
3) You should now be able to run MNIST_nLayer and MNIST_CNN 

# NOTE: I apologize for the bad coding style.  I coded these back when I was still "new" to coding and did not write them with the intention of looking back on them or having others read them :(

Descriptions of the zipped files:

mnist: library I use only for reading the mnist files.  This is not my code but unfortunately I can't find the library I used anymore (I think it was updated b/c I can't find the one I used).

ConvolutionalPreprocessing: Used to preprocess images for the CNN.  

MNIST_CNN: A convolutional Neural Net that I achieved 93.77% accuracy on the test data with.
